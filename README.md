<img height='35' src='https://github.com/btarg/Origami/blob/master/crane.png?raw=true' /> Currently developing [Origami](https://github.com/btarg/Origami), a Minecraft server plugin for creating custom content for vanilla clients.

My favourite programming language is C#, and I mostly focus on game development and modding. I code in my spare time to learn as much as I can, and to create the best and simplest solutions to problems I have with existing software.

I also own and operate [the 21st portfolio](https://21stportfolio.com), a student-run literature blog, and occasionally write poetry and reviews.
