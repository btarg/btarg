My favourite programming language is C#, and I mostly focus on game development and modding. I code in my spare time to learn as much as I can and to create the best solutions to problems I have with existing software and games.

I also own and operate [the 21st portfolio](https://21stportfolio.com), a student-run literature blog, and I occasionally write poetry and reviews for the site.

## Projects

### [Project Requiem (WIP)](https://github.com/btarg/third-person-controller)
Project Requiem is a work-in-progress turn-based RPG made in [**Godot 4**](https://godotengine.org) using **GDScript**. It is heavily story-driven and features an expansive design document with over 6,000 words outlining the gameâ€™s intricate narrative and mechanics. [You can explore the design doc here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ciNLXNb76iGfoPWgEIhHHFKyTaYyUXYv_RmkQ1yvwhU/edit?usp=sharing).
#### Creating the project
In this project, I make heavy use of **state machines** to manage the gameplay flow. For example:

- **Exploration vs. Battle**: State machines manage whether the player is in exploration mode or engaged in battle.
- **Character Battle States**: During battles, each character has a state machine that determines whether they are attacking, defending, waiting, etc.

While **GDScript** was a new language for me, my previous experience with **C# in Unity** and **AngelScript in Unreal Engine** allowed me to quickly adapt and implement gameplay systems effectively.

The design of my data structures and gameplay flow is informed by previous attempts at creating similar RPG mechanics in Unity and Unreal Engine, as well as working with others (especially the friendly people in the official Godot Discord server) to collect feedback and improve gameplay.

### [ByteReserve](https://github.com/btarg/AWS-Upload) (halted for now)
ByteReserve is a pay-as-you-go, end-to-end encrypted file upload service (similar to **DropBox**, for example). The current code in the repo does not work, as I stopped developing it mid-rewrite.
ByteReserve is my first large-scale full-stack **JavaScript** application.

It uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on the backend, and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) on the frontend. This was my first time making a dynamic and responsible frontend user experience, but I was quickly able to adapt to using Vue from previous experience writing basic HTML pages for other projects.

### [Origami](https://github.com/btarg/origami) (Abandoned)
Origami is a Minecraft server plugin for the [Paper](https://papermc.org/) platform, which allows for server owners to create more a customised experience closer to that of modded Minecraft, regardless of the players' clients.

I used many tricks and hacks present in vanilla Minecraft code to create custom blocks and items, implementing a system which allowed the server owner to write simple **YAML files** to define custom properties for each item or block.

Other, more feature-complete alternatives exist now for server-side modding, but I learned a lot about backend and server development.
