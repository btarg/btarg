[Origami](https://github.com/btarg/Origami), is my Minecraft server plugin for creating custom content such as blocks and items, with support for vanilla game clients.

My favourite programming language is C#, and I mostly focus on game development and modding. I code in my spare time to learn as much as I can, and to create the best solutions to problems I have with existing software and games.

I also own and operate [the 21st portfolio](https://21stportfolio.com), a student-run literature blog, and I occasionally write poetry and reviews for the site.
